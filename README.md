# 🕸️ Absurd Website Bingo

Welcome to **Bigno** — the chaotic neutral cousin of bingo, where instead of numbers you get served **random, weird, possibly fake, probably cursed websites**. Some are real. Some are... manifestations of the Internet’s subconscious. Either way, you're going on a trip.

## 🎯 What is Bigno?

A 5x5 bingo grid.  
Every square is a strange website.  
Click a square. The link opens. Maybe you win. Maybe you question reality.

It's not just a game. It's an experience.  
And maybe a social experiment. But mostly a bad idea done really well.

## 🌀 Features

- 🔁 Shuffled board each round (no two horrors alike!)
- 🌐 Massive pool of absurd domains (users can add fake ones via PRs!)
- 🧠 Surreal vibes & dark UI, like late-night Wikipedia spirals
- 🏆 Win condition? We don’t even know. But you’ll feel it in your bones.

> Pro tip: some links work. Some don’t. That’s part of the magic.
